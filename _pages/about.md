Hi, Iâ€™m Jake, a process design engineer with a passion for sustainability. With nearly three years under my belt, I've honed my skills in operating, designing, and refining industrial processes. Feel free to explore the 'Portfolio' tab for a glimpse into my recent projects!

As an Auburn University alumnus, I hold a Bachelor's of Science in Chemical Engineering, where I learned the fundamentals of first-principles engineering. Along my professional journey, I've gained expertise in 'programmatic engineering,' empowering me to merge engineering principles with process simulation and advanced design methods.

Some of my proudest achievements include developing a reinforcement learning process simulation platform (see  [Distillery Process Simulation]( {% link _projects/process-simulation.md %} ))
and a custom network data scraper that compiled 30 years of procurement data into a searchable database (see  [Building a Database of Historical Procurement Data]( {% link _projects/database.md %} )), enabling my firm to glean insights from their institutional knowledge-base not previously possible.

Besides engineering, I enjoy traveling and exploring new cultures and landscapes. Unfortunately, I had a serious injury while traveling in Vietnam last year, which prevented me from working for several months. However, this period of recovery and reflection sparked a reevaluation of my career goals, solidifying my commitment to work with organizations striving for a sustainable, resilient future.

If you're in search of a process design engineer with a flair for innovation, a knack for team collaboration, and the adaptability to thrive in dynamic environments, I'd be thrilled to connect. You can reach me at jakeheinereng@gmail.com or 530-227-5002. Thanks for stopping by my portfolio, and have a fantastic day!
