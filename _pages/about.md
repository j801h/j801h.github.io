Hi, Iâ€™m Jake, a process design engineer with a passion for sustainability. I have nearly three years of experience in operating, designing, and optimizing industrial processes.

I have a Bachelor's of Science in Chemical Engineering from Auburn University, where I learned the fundamentals of first-principles engineering. I also have a (certification or credential) in (area of expertise), which demonstrates my commitment to continuous learning and professional development.

Some of my proudest achievements include (briefly describe one or two projects or awards that showcase your skills and impact). For example, I (describe what you did and what was the outcome).

Besides engineering, I enjoy (personal details that relate to your career goals or interests). For instance, I love traveling and exploring new cultures and landscapes. Unfortunately, I had a serious injury while traveling in Vietnam last year, which prevented me from working for several months. However, I used this time to recover, reflect, and reevaluate my career aspirations. I realized that I want to work for a company that shares my vision of creating a more sustainable and resilient world.

If you are looking for a process design engineer who can deliver innovative solutions, collaborate effectively with diverse teams, and adapt to changing environments, I would love to hear from you. You can reach me at jakeheinereng@gmail.com or 530-227-5002. Thank you for visiting my portfolio and have a great day!
