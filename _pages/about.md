Hello! I'm Jake, a process design engineer with a passion for sustainability and nearly three years of experience in operating, designing, and refining industrial processes. Please take a moment to explore the 'Portfolio' tab to discover some of my recent projects.

As an alumnus of Auburn University, I hold a Bachelor of Science degree in Chemical Engineering. This education provided me with a solid foundation in first-principles engineering and allowed me to develop expertise in programmatic engineering, adeptly integrating engineering principles with process simulation and advanced design methodologies.

Among my proudest achievements are the development of a reinforcement learning process simulation platform (see [Distillery Process Simulation]( {% link _projects/process-simulation.md %} )) and the creation of a custom network data scraper that compiled 30 years of procurement data into a searchable database (see [Building a Database of Historical Procurement Data]( {% link _projects/database.md %} )). These accomplishments enabled my firm to extract valuable insights from previously untapped institutional knowledge.

Outside of engineering, I love traveling and immersing myself in new cultures and landscapes. A serious injury during a trip to Vietnam last year temporarily halted my career, but this period of recovery and reflection led me to reassess my career goals and reaffirm my commitment to working with organizations dedicated to a sustainable, resilient future.

If you're seeking a process design engineer with a flair for innovation, strong team collaboration skills, and the adaptability to excel in dynamic environments, I'd be delighted to connect. You can reach me at jakeheinereng@gmail.com or 530-227-5002. Thank you for visiting my portfolio, and I hope you have a fantastic day!
