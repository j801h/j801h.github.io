### Role: Junior Process Engineer

I had the opportunity to work alongside a senior process engineer in conducting a system bottleneck study for a nutritional beverage and supplements production facility. The highly manual nature of the system required thorough data collection and analysis to identify opportunities for optimization and process improvement.

### Responsibilities and Achievements:

- Collaborated with a senior process engineer to conduct a system bottleneck study for a nutritional beverage and supplements production facility.
- Collected extensive data over a one-week period, including process pressures, temperatures, batching times, system downtime, etc., to analyze the production process.
- Identified that the client's most popular product was frequently batched at temperatures causing significant burn-on in the primary shell-and-tube heat exchanger, which increased the pressure drop across the exchanger over time.
- Recognized that the manual nature of the batching process allowed operators to send the product through the exchanger at higher-than-acceptable temperatures, as established by the client's QA team.
- Developed and proposed a solution involving a strict control scheme and a new plate-and-frame heat exchanger that allowed for increased throughput over a small footprint, which was ultimately accepted by the client.

### Results:
Through close collaboration with the senior process engineer and meticulous data analysis, we successfully identified bottlenecks in the production process and proposed a solution that optimized the system. This experience enhanced my understanding of process engineering, data analysis, and effective problem-solving.
