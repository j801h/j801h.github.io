### Role: Junior Process Engineer
<br>

### Summary
As a Junior Process Engineer, I collaborated with a senior process engineer to conduct a system bottleneck analysis for a nutritional beverage and supplements production facility. Our objective was to improve the production process throughput by identifying inefficiencies and suggesting appropriate solutions. By systematically collecting and analyzing data, we identified crucial bottlenecks and proposed a solution that the client accepted. This solution increased the facility's production capacity, improved energy efficiency, and minimized manual intervention in batching operations, allowing staff to better manage equipment and predict production requirements.

### The Quick Take-Away
This project highlights my experience identifying and addressing inefficiencies in complex production systems. By conducting a thorough bottleneck study, we improved the client's production process while reducing waste and resource consumption.

My experience in data analysis, collaboration, and best-practices-based problem-solving is directly transferable to areas in which identifying inefficiencies and implementing actionable solutions is crucial.

By leveraging my process engineering background and problem-solving skills, I can contribute to the development of sustainable processes and technologies that promote waste reduction.

### Responsibilities and Achievements:

- Collaborated with a senior process engineer to conduct a system bottleneck study for a nutritional beverage and supplements production facility.
- Collected extensive data over a one-week period, including process pressures, temperatures, batching times, system downtime, etc., to analyze the production process.
- Identified that the client's most popular product was frequently batched at temperatures causing significant burn-on in the primary shell-and-tube heat exchanger, which increased the pressure drop across the exchanger over time.
- Recognized that the manual nature of the batching process allowed operators to send the product through the exchanger at higher-than-acceptable temperatures, as established by the client's QA team.
- Developed and proposed a solution involving a strict control scheme and a new plate-and-frame heat exchanger that allowed for increased throughput over a small footprint, which was ultimately accepted by the client.

### Results:
Through close collaboration with the senior process engineer and meticulous data analysis, we successfully identified bottlenecks in the production process and proposed a solution that optimized the system. This experience enhanced my understanding of process engineering, data analysis, and effective problem-solving.

__Project Outcomes:__

- __Comprehensive data collection and analysis__: Because this process had served as the company's proof-of-concept pilot plant, the process lacked the high degree of automation common to more mature facilities. This necessitated the manual collection from analog sensor outputs (think strip chart-recorders).
- __Identification of bottlenecks and inefficiencies__: by comparing the examined process unit throughputs to their respective designed theoretical throughput values, we determined that the primary shell-and-tube heat exchanger used for product pasteurization had become a significant bottleneck to process throughput.
- __Proposed solution and its benefits__: our primary proposal involved the implementation of a new, lower-footprint plate-and-frame heat exchanger, controlled via upstream flowrates and temperature data (using new sensors) on a PID control loop. While P&F exchangers do generally exhibit greater head-loss than their S&T counterparts, the available footprint for the design was smaller than necessary for a comparable S&T exchanger to accommodate the increased throughput our client was seeking. Further, the implementation of the temperature-controlled pasteurization loop would prevent the burn-on issue, and ultimately decrease long-term pressure drop build-up and the need for frequent maintenance.
- __Client acceptance and implementation__: our client ultimately accepted our primary recommendations and implemented our design with the help of their usual construction partner.


This project experience provided me with invaluable knowledge and skill development in the areas of process engineering, data analysis, and problem-solving. Working closely with a senior process engineer, I gained hands-on experience in conducting system bottleneck analyses, collecting and analyzing data, and identifying inefficiencies in a production process. Additionally, I developed the ability to propose effective solutions tailored to the unique needs of a client, resulting in improved production capacity, energy efficiency, and reduced waste. This experience has not only strengthened my technical expertise but also enhanced my ability to collaborate and communicate with diverse stakeholders. Moving forward, I am confident in my capacity to tackle complex challenges and contribute to the development of sustainable and efficient processes in various industries.
