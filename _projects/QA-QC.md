### Role: Project QA/QC Co-Lead

At the height of the pandemic, I was tasked with joining the QA/QC effort on a large process expansion project, and quickly advanced to QA/QC co-lead, supervising a team of five engineers executing QA/QC work for all work performed on the project. This project was a top priority for my firm, as supply-chain issues put it at risk of entering a phase of liquidated damages (contract terms outlined pre-Covid). It was essential to complete work as quickly as possible and collaborate across teams as effectively as possible in order to productively advance the project.



### Responsibilities and Achievements:

- Successfully co-led a team of engineers in a 12-month project, ensuring QA/QC standards were met for a $260MM process expansion project. 
- Collaborated closely with domain experts (spanning Process Mechanical, Electrical, Controls, Utilities, and Architectural domains) to evaluate and audit subcontractor work, proposing necessary corrections to maintain quality.
- Utilized the CxAlloy software tool to effectively track work progress through each stage of construction, identifying and addressing potential issues. All project work was audited across five levels:
    - L1: FAT - ensuring equipment met standards prior to shipping to site
    - L2: Delivered equipment audited against design specifications
    - L3: Proper Installation of Equipment / Completion of Project Scope
    - L4: Dry Testing of Project Systems
    - L5: Wet Testing of Project Systems
- Worked hand-in-hand with contractors, ensuring timely completion of work that met required standards.
- Successfully audited and documented all work performed over 12 months

### Results:

Through our team's consistent efforts and the efficient application of CxAlloy, we successfully expanded the pet food factory process, doubling its capacity. By actively engaging with stakeholders and maintaining a focus on quality, we secured the project's success. This project offered valuable experience in project management, quality assurance, and stakeholder collaboration.
