### Role: Project QA/QC Co-Lead
<br>

### Summary
At the height of the pandemic, I was tasked with joining the QA/QC effort on a large process expansion project, and quickly advanced to QA/QC co-lead, supervising a team of five engineers executing QA/QC work for all work performed on the project. This project was a top priority for my firm, as supply-chain issues put it at risk of entering a phase of liquidated damages (contract terms outlined pre-Covid). It was essential to complete work as quickly as possible and collaborate across teams as effectively as possible in order to productively advance the project.

### The Speed-Reader's 'So-What'
The significance of my role as QA/QC Co-Lead on this process expansion project demonstrates my ability to adapt and excel under pressure, as well as to collaborate effectively with diverse stakeholders to ensure project success. By applying these critical project management and quality assurance skills to your field, dear reader, I hope to contribute to the development of innovative, eco-conscious projects that prioritize both efficiency and environmental impact.

My experience in managing complex projects, navigating supply-chain challenges, and ensuring quality across all project stages will be invaluable in driving sustainable solutions. The ability to coordinate effectively with various teams and maintain stringent quality standards is crucial to ensure the successful implementation of sustainable practices and technologies. My background in construction management, coupled with my expertise in QA/QC, positions me to make a significant impact by delivering high-quality, eco-conscious projects that align with industry goals and contribute to a greener, more sustainable future.

### Responsibilities and Achievements:

- Successfully co-led a team of engineers in a 12-month project, ensuring QA/QC standards were met for a $260MM process expansion project. 
- Collaborated closely with domain experts (spanning Process Mechanical, Electrical, Controls, Utilities, and Architectural domains) to evaluate and audit subcontractor work, proposing necessary corrections to maintain quality.
- Utilized the CxAlloy software tool to effectively track work progress through each stage of construction, identifying and addressing potential issues. All project work was audited across five levels:
    - L1: FAT - ensuring equipment met standards prior to shipping to site
    - L2: Delivered equipment audited against design specifications
    - L3: Proper Installation of Equipment / Completion of Project Scope
    - L4: Dry Testing of Project Systems
    - L5: Wet Testing of Project Systems
- Worked hand-in-hand with contractors, ensuring timely completion of work that met required standards.
- Successfully audited and documented all work performed over 12 months

### Results:

Through our team's consistent efforts and the efficient application of CxAlloy, we successfully expanded the pet food factory process, doubling its capacity. By actively engaging with stakeholders and maintaining a focus on quality, we secured the project's success. This project offered valuable experience in project management, quality assurance, and stakeholder collaboration.
