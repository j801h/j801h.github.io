### Role: Project QA/QC Co-Lead
<br>

### Summary
At the height of the pandemic,  I was assigned to the QA/QC initiative on a significant process expansion project. As I adapted to the situation, I became the QA/QC co-lead, managing a team of five engineers handling QA/QC tasks for the project. The project was important for my firm due to supply-chain disruptions and the risk of liquidated damages according to pre-Covid contractual terms. Completing work efficiently and facilitating teamwork across various teams were essential for the project's advancement.

### The Speed-Reader's 'So-What'
As the QA/QC Co-Lead on this process expansion project, I demonstrated the ability to work under pressure and collaborate effectively with diverse stakeholders. I aim to apply these project management and quality assurance skills in your domain, supporting the creation of innovative, eco-conscious projects that promote efficiency and limit ecological impact.

My experience in managing complex projects, addressing supply-chain difficulties, and maintaining quality throughout projects will enable me to contribute to sustainable solutions.

### Responsibilities and Achievements:

- Successfully co-led a team of engineers in a 12-month project, ensuring QA/QC standards were met for a $260MM process expansion project. 
- Collaborated closely with domain experts (spanning Process Mechanical, Electrical, Controls, Utilities, and Architectural domains) to evaluate and audit subcontractor work, proposing necessary corrections to maintain quality.
- Utilized CxAlloy software tool to effectively track work progress through each stage of construction, identifying and addressing potential issues. Audited all project work across five levels:
    - L1: FAT - ensuring equipment met standards prior to shipping to site
    - L2: Delivered equipment audited against design specifications
    - L3: Proper Installation of Equipment / Completion of Project Scope
    - L4: Dry Testing of Project Systems
    - L5: Wet Testing of Project Systems
- Worked hand-in-hand with contractors, ensuring timely completion of work that met required standards.
- Audited and documented all work performed over 12 months

### Results:

Through our team's consistent efforts, we successfully expanded the pet food factory process, effectively doubling its capacity. This project offered valuable experience in project management, quality assurance, and stakeholder collaboration.
