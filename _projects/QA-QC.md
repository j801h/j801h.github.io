### Project: Dogfood Factory Process Expansion (100% Capacity Increase)

### Overview
I had the opportunity to lead a team of engineers on an exciting project to expand a dogfood factory process and increase capacity by 100% over the course of 12 months. My role was to ensure that all work met the highest standards of quality assurance/quality control (QA/QC), which involved working closely with domain experts to audit work done by various subcontractors and using the 'CxAlloy' software tool to track progress through each stage of construction. Thanks to the hard work and collaboration of everyone involved, we were able to successfully complete the project on time and within budget.

### Responsibilities
- Collaborated closely with domain experts to ensure that all work met the highest QA/QC standards.

- Audited work done by various subcontractors and proposed corrections where necessary.

- Led a team of engineers through the process of QA/QC over nine months.

- Used the 'CxAlloy' software tool to track work progress through each stage of construction.

- Worked closely with contractors to ensure that all work was performed on time and to the required standards.


### Results
Thanks to our team's diligent efforts and attention to detail, we were able to successfully expand the dogfood factory process and increase capacity by 100%. Our use of the 'CxAlloy' software tool allowed us to catch and correct any issues before they became larger problems, and our collaboration with all stakeholders ensured that the project met their high standards. It was a pleasure to work with such a talented and dedicated team, and I am grateful for the experience.

Overall, this project was a great opportunity for me to develop my skills in managing complex projects, maintaining high standards of quality, and collaborating effectively with stakeholders. I am proud of what we accomplished together and look forward to bringing this same level of dedication and expertise to future projects.
