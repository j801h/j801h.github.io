### Role: Process Engineer Intern
<br>

### Introduction

In this project, I conducted an in-depth performance analysis of a shell-and-tube heat exchanger at a fertilizer production plant. The goal was to evaluate the heat exchanger's current performance against its theoretical and historical performance data, ultimately determining the need for maintenance due to fouling.

### The Speed-Reader's 'So-What'
As a Process Engineer Intern, I was tasked with analyzing a shell-and-tube heat exchanger at a fertilizer production plant. In doing so, I discovered notable fouling issues that necessitated maintenance. By systematically comparing theoretical, historical, and current performance data, I recognized a decrease in the heat exchanger's efficiency and the importance of prompt intervention.

By taking a proactive approach, I contributed to a 33% increase in the heat exchanger's effectiveness. This improvement optimized plant operations, reduced energy costs, and mitigated the risk of equipment failure. This work demonstrates my ability to identify and address performance concerns in essential industrial processes, ultimately supporting the overall efficiency and sustainability of operations.

### Background

- Shell-and-tube heat exchangers are critical components in many industrial processes, including fertilizer production
- Fouling is a common issue that can lead to decreased efficiency, higher operational costs, and potential equipment failure

### Data Collection

- Collected historical performance data of the heat exchanger and surrounding series of evaporators, including flow rates, temperatures, and pressure drops
- Calculated design specifications for the surrounding multi-effect evaporation process and theoretical performance data for comparison

### Thermodynamic Analysis
- Used thermodynamic principles to calculate the heat transfer coefficients and effectiveness of the heat exchanger
- Compared the calculated values with the design specifications and historical data

### Statistical Analysis:
- Performed statistical tests to identify trends and anomalies in the performance data
Used regression analysis to determine the relationship between various parameters and the overall heat transfer efficiency

### Results

- Identified a significant decline in heat exchanger performance (it was operating at 60% of its designed load), indicating fouling issues
- Heat transfer coefficients and effectiveness values were considerably lower than theoretical and historical values
- Statistical analysis revealed a strong correlation between fouling and decreased heat transfer efficiency

### Conclusion

The performance analysis of the shell-and-tube heat exchanger revealed significant fouling, necessitating the equipment to be pulled for maintenance. This proactive approach helped optimize the plant's operations, reduce energy costs, and prevent potential equipment failure.

### Acknowledgments

As a then sophomore in undergrad who had not yet taken Thermo, I have to credit my former supervisor, Eric Bidinger, with assigning this project to me and recognizing its likely outcomes. With his excellent mentorship, we did ultimately pull and clean the heat exchanger, improving its effectiveness by ~33%.
