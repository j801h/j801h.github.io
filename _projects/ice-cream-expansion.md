### Role: Construction Management Supervisor

During a major ice-cream facility expansion, I took on the role of Construction Management Supervisor to oversee the successful completion of the project. With a focus on safety, quality, and clear communication, I led the construction efforts, including the addition of five new production lines to increase the client's capacity.

### Responsibilities and Achievements:

- Successfully managed a large-scale ice-cream facility expansion, adding five new production lines and increasing the client's production capacity.
- Supervised mechanical, electrical, and controls construction, working closely with client and subcontractor stakeholders to prioritize and schedule tasks.
- Implemented and enforced Lockout-Tagout (LOTO) procedures throughout the project, ensuring the safety of all personnel.
- Audited work against original scope documents (e.g., bid package contracts, functional descriptions, and P&IDs), overseeing QA/QC and wet-testing of completed systems to maintain project quality.
- Served as the primary on-site point of contact, facilitating clear communication between all parties and managing inventory of equipment and materials.
- Seamlessly integrated additional scope items requested by the client through conducting as-built system studies and integrating changes into the project.
- Provided regular, detailed project status reports to stakeholders, ensuring transparency and alignment.

### Results:
Through effective supervision, safety enforcement, and communication, the ice-cream facility expansion project was completed successfully, substantially increasing the client's production capacity. This experience provided valuable insight into construction management, safety procedures, and stakeholder collaboration.
